# portfolio-optimizer
![CI](https://github.com/diegomihanovich/portfolio-optimizer/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

A simple web tool for experimenting with portfolio optimization strategies.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository and install Node.js (v20 or later recommended).
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the test suite with:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
4. To try the application, open `index.html` directly in your browser or serve the project locally. Any static file server will work, e.g.:
   ```bash
   npx serve
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```
